  <p id="about">
    <span id="hello"> Hello, </span> and welcome to my website to learn more
    about me and the exciting projects I have worked on!
  </p>
  <p>
    My name is Shivani Patel and I will receive my Bachelor’s degree confirming a major in Information Science,
    and minors in Biometry and Statistics and Business, from Cornell University in the spring of 2019.
    I'm passionate about improving the world, and hope to do so through project management, data analysis, or web development!
  </p>
  <p> My first two years at Cornell I studied Biometry and Statistics, allowing me to
    solidify my probability and statistical computation ability.  After switching to
    Information Science, I learned how to analyze this data through computing. I also
    have taken many classes pertaining to web design and programming and the human-computer
    interaction. Along with an Information Science degree, I have completed a Business
    minor to help apply my knowledge in computing and data analytics to the workplace.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the summer of 2017, I used my statistical skills as a Research and Development/
    Information Technology Intern at TaylorMade Adidas-golf. With the opportunity to process
    and analyze big data with MATLAB and Excel, creating predictive models, and use my findings
    to determine next steps, I saw how data science could be used to develop meaningful results.
    I was able to take the work I did, and identify ways to improve products and promote growth with
    new ideas. This opportunity inspired me to switch my major to Information Science, where I could
    further my skills in data analysis and how to apply these results.
  </p>
  <p> After switching to study Information Science, I learned Python and SQL in addition to R.
    From a more creative standpoint, studying Information Science has taught me SQL, HTML, CSS, PHP,
    and JavaScript.  I have been exposed to designing technologies to better suit consumers’ needs,
    and I truly enjoy brainstorming how to make the world a more user-friendly place. Through my
    internship with Math & Movement, I improved search engine optimization and used knowledge of
    human-computer interaction to work on the web design and better engage the target audience.
    I further utilized these skills as a Project Management Intern for J Crew’s E-Commerce team this
    past summer 2018 and took my knowledge of technology to help manage web development projects.
  </p>
  <p> Outside of my academic studies, I have been involved in a number of organizations.
    I am an active member of Alpha Phi Omega, a professional community service fraternity,
    which organizes and volunteers at events to build both the Cornell and Ithaca communities.
    I have also acted as treasurer for The SchoolGirl Project, which strives to build
    awareness and fundraise to increase education opportunities for those in underserved countries.
